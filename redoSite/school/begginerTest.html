    <p>This is a paragraph, it is pretty cool. You can display long strings of text with verry correct spelling.</p>
    <p style="color: red;">HELP, I'M RED!!!</p>

    <div id="scissors">
        <p>This is <em class="paper">interesting</em>.</p>

    <p>Apparently the div tags that are used there don't actually do anything.</p>

    <p>A friend of mine once told me a <q>joke</q>. It went a little something like this: <q>I tried to catch fog yesterday.</q> And then I said <q>Oh, how did that go?</q>And then he said, <q>Mist.</q> And being the single braincelled small brain that I am, I didn't know what it meant. Thankfully he told me it was a joke and I found this hnady definition on Wikipedia:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke">
        <p>A joke is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh and is not meant to be taken seriously. It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a punch line.</p>

    <p>This is a list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It has a dot</li>
        <li>And another dot</li>
        <li>hey, where'd that 4th dot come from?</li>
        <li>&lt;---- that one</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And some numbers:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>one</li>
        <li>two</li>
        <li>three</li>
        <li>and four</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>I'm very big</h1>
    <h2>I'm less big</h2>
    <h3>Annoyingly there's no one in the middle.</h3>
    <h4>Yeah, that's pretty dumb to be honest.</h4>
    <h5>For a heading, I'm small</h5>
    <h6>You think you're small!?</h6>
